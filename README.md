# How to add custom music:

1. download zip and extract
2. go to assets folder then go to assets/timm/sounds/
3. put any new song in ogg format into the sounds directory (MAKE SURE THE FILE NAME ONLY USES LOWERCASE LETTERS, NUMBERS, DASHES, AND UNDERSCORES)
  - example: `Example song.ogg` needs to become `example_song.ogg`
4. go to sounds.json in assets/timm/ of the pack and add your custom song
  - example: adding `custom_plains.ogg`
  ```
  "plains": {
    "sounds": [
      "timm:plains-01",
      "timm:plains-02",
      ADD HERE: "timm:custom_plains"
    ]
  },
  ```
  - note: when adding songs to a list, make sure you add commas properly
  - example:
  ```
  "plains": {
    "sounds": [
      "timm:plains-01",
      "timm:plains-02"
      "timm:custom_plains"
    ]
  },
  ```
  - the above example is wrong because there is no comma after `"timm:plains-02"`
5. ZIP the assets folder and pack.mcmeta then you're good to go

# How to replace music:

1. follow above steps 1 - 4 to add the music you want to add
2. to remove unwanted songs, just remove them from the sounds.json and delete the ogg file from the sounds directory
3. if you wish to remove entire sound groups, you need to also remove them from the biome_playlists.json provided
  - example: i want to remove the plains songs
  ```
  ----------------------------------
  sounds.json
  ----------------------------------
  
  ...

  "ocean": {
    "sounds": [
      "timm:deep_ocean-01",
      "timm:ocean-01"
    ]
  },

  -------- REMOVE FROM HERE --------
  "plains": {
    "sounds": [
      "timm:plains-01",
      "timm:plains-02"
    ]
  },
  --------- REMOVE TO HERE ---------

  "snow_plains": {
    "sounds": [
      "timm:snow_plains-01",
      "timm:snow_plains-02",
      "timm:snow_plains-03"
    ]
  },

  ...

  ```

  ```
  ----------------------------------
  biome_playlists.json
  ----------------------------------
  
  ...

    "minecraft:savanna": [
      "timm:savanna",
      "minecraft:music.game"
    ]***,***
  -------- REMOVE FROM HERE --------
    "minecraft:plains": [
      "timm:plains",
      "minecraft:music.game"
    ]
  --------- REMOVE TO HERE ---------
  }

  NOTE: Make sure to remove the comma with asterisks around it, since plains is the last item in the list
  ```

  ```
  ----------------------------------
  assets/timm/sounds/
  ----------------------------------
  
  ...

  nether_wastes-01.ogg
  ocean-01.ogg
  -------- REMOVE FROM HERE --------
  plains-01.ogg
  plains-02.ogg
  --------- REMOVE TO HERE ---------
  savanna-01.ogg
  snow_plains-01.ogg

  ...

  ```

4. ZIP the assets folder and pack.mcmeta
5. replace your biome_playlists.json generated by timm (found in `.minecraft/config/timm/`) with the one you just modified

NOTE: if you entirely remove a sound group from biome_playlists.json, the mod will attempt to play the fallback playlist. if the fallback playlist is removed, the mod will crash, and the mod may also crash if the fallback playlist has a length of 0. However, if you wish to leave the fallback playlist empty, you can safely turn `timm:my_sound` into an empty song and put it as the only song in the fallback playlist, as that song is not used anywhere in the mod.
